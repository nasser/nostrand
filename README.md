# Nostrand
Standalone runtime environment and REPL for ClojureCLR on Mono.

## Status
Very early, pre-alpha. Everything will change. Don't use for anything critical.

## Installing

1. clone the `nostrand` repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nasser/nostrand.git
```

2. Fetch the last `magic` dlls

Go to [nasser/magic/actions](https://github.com/nasser/magic/actions).

Click on the last worflow run, scroll down and download the artifact `magic-assemblies`.

Copy the dlls inside the `nostrand/references` folder.

3. Build and REPL

```
$ cd nostrand
$ dotnet build -c Release
$ ln -s `pwd`/bin/x64/Release/net471/nos ~/bin/
$ nos repl
Nostrand 0.2.1.0 (master/4115065 Sat 08 Feb 2020 05:50:17 PM EST)
Mono 6.4.0 (makepkg/fe64a4765e6 Sat 16 Nov 2019 04:59:42 PM UTC)
Clojure 1.10.0-master-SNAPSHOT
REPL 0.0.0.0:11217

```

## Usage

```
nos FUNCTION [ARG...]
```

Nostrand does one thing: it runs a function.

Functions are Clojure functions. Without a namespace, they resolve to the `nostrand.tasks` namespace which is built in.

```
$ nos version
Nostrand 0.0.1.6940 (master/a1e4260* Mon Nov 28 03:51:20 EST 2016)
Mono 4.8.0 (mono-4.8.0-branch/f5fbc32 Mon Nov 14 14:18:03 EST 2016)
Clojure 1.7.0-master-SNAPSHOT

$ nos repl
Nostrand 0.0.1.6940 (master/a1e4260* Mon Nov 28 03:51:20 EST 2016)
Mono 4.8.0 (mono-4.8.0-branch/f5fbc32 Mon Nov 14 14:18:03 EST 2016)
Clojure 1.7.0-master-SNAPSHOT
REPL 0.0.0.0:11217
user>
```

With a namespace they are searched for using Clojure's normal namespace resolution machinery. The current directory is on the load path by default.

```clojure
$ cat tasks.clj
(ns tasks)

(defn build []
  (binding [*compile-path* "build"]
    (compile 'important.core)
    (compile 'important.util)))

$ nos tasks/build
```

Command line arguments are parsed as EDN passed to the function.

```clojure
$ cat tasks.clj
(ns tasks)

(defn build [utils?]
  (binding [*compile-path* "build"]
    (compile 'important.core)
    (when utils?
      (compile 'important.util))))

$ nos tasks/build true
```

Your entry namespace can also set up your classpath, load assemblies, and eventually manage dependencies.  

```clojure
$ cat tasks.clj
(assembly-load-from "assemblies/SomeLib.dll")
(ns tasks
  (:import [SomeLib SomeType]))

(defn build [utils?]
  (SomeType/DoThing)
  (binding [*compile-path* "build"]
    (compile 'important.core)
    (when utils?
      (compile 'important.util))))

$ nos tasks/build true
```

### `project.edn`
If a file named `project.edn` is present in the current directory, it will be parsed at startup to configure initialization. It is expected to be an EDN map, and the following keys are recognized:

* `:source-paths` A vector of paths to load Clojure namespaces from. The default is the current directory.
* `:assembly-paths` A vector of paths to load assemblies from.
* `:references` A vector of assembly names to reference.
* `:dependencies` A vector of package coordinates your project depends on

### Dependencies

Nostrand supports packages from Maven Central and Clojars, as well as github and NuGet. `project.edn`'s `:dependencies` key accepts a vector of package coordinates of the form `[source name version]` , where `source` is a keyword that specifies which repository to pull from, `name` is a symbol that specifies the name of the package, and `version` is a string that specifies the verison of the package. `name` and `version` will depend on the `source`.

For example, the [MAGIC project's](https://github.com/nasser/magic) [`project.edn`](https://github.com/nasser/magic/blob/master/project.edn) contains:

```clojure
:dependencies [[:github nasser/mage "master"]
               [:github nasser/test.check "master"]
               [:maven org.clojure/tools.analyzer "0.6.9"]]
```

#### `:github`
Github sources clone a whole repository as a dependency.

- `name` takes the form `username/repository` and `version` is anything that refers to a commit (sha recommended).
- You must provide both `branch` and `sha` if you want to download the zip of a specific branch.
- For private repo, the `token` must be provided and the `sha`.
- Be careful with GitHub personal token has they cannot be set to read only! (For your private GitHub repo, it is advised to create a dummy account with read-only access on your repos and generate the token from this dummy user.)

```clojure
[;; public repo
 [:github skydread1/my-public-lib "feature-1"
  :sha "46bb12e33ae4fe118a1aa91d2985f1f2f3192366"
  :paths ["src"]]
 ;; private repo
 [:github skydread1/my-private-lib "master"
  :paths ["src"]
  :sha "46bb12e33ae4fe118a1aa91d2985f1f2f3192367"
  :token "xxxxxxxxxxxxx"]]
```

#### `:gitlab`
Gitlab sources clone a whole repository as a dependency.

- `name` takes the form `username/repository` and `version` is  anything that refers to a commit (sha recommended).
- The `branch`, `sha` and the `project-id` must be provided for public and private repository.
- For private repository, `domain` and access `token` are required as well.

```clojure
[;; public repo
 [:gitlab skydread1/my-public-lib "master"
  :paths ["src"]
  :sha "46bb12e33ae4fe118a1aa91d2985f1f2f3192366"
  :project-id "777"]
 ;; private repo
 [:gitlab skydread1/my-private-lib "master"
  :paths ["src"]
  :sha "46bb12e33ae4fe118a1aa91d2985f1f2f3192367"
  :token "xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  :domain "dev.hello.sg"
  :project-id "888"]]
```

The root of the repository is the only directory added to the load path by default, but you can specify subdirectories by adding `:paths` followed by a vector of strings to the coordinate.

#### `:nuget`
`name` and `version` are the same as you would pass in to `nuget install name -Version version`.

You can pack and push packages easily with the convenient function `tasks/nuget-push`.

#### `:maven`
Behaves as in Leiningen. Note that many Clojure packages will not work on ClojurCLR without modification, as they may reference Java classes that are not present on the CLR.
